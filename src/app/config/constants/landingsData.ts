Combine them with granola, raisins and nuts in snacks and cereals, or use them instead of nuts in baked goods. <br/><br/>Pumpkin seeds don’t contribute as much protein as beans, meat or some dairy products, but because they contribute protein to the complex carbohydrates found in cereals, salads and breads, they are useful for building a balanced meal. <br/><br/>As a source of protein, pumpkin seeds compare favorably to other seeds and to nuts. To consume the 25 g to 28 g of protein found in the recommended 3g. serving of tuna or 1 cup of soybeans, you’d have to eat about 2 cups of dried pumpkin seeds. <br/>That’s 613 calories, compared to the 110 calories of the tuna or the 298 calories of the soybeans. 1oz. of pumpkin seeds offers almost 30 percent of the recommended daily amount of zinc and 20 percent of the recommended amount of iron.

Coriander is native to regions spanning from southern Europe and North Africa to southwestern Asia. It is a soft, hairless plant growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the centre of the umbel longer (5–6 mm) than those pointing towards it (only 1–3 mm long). The fruit is a globular, dry schizocarp 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) in diameter.\n' +
            'The dry fruits are known as coriander seeds. In Indian cuisine they are called dhania. The word “coriander” in food preparation may refer solely to these seeds (as a spice), rather than to the plant. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when crushed, due to terpenes linalool and pinene. It is described as warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured.\n' +
            'The variety C. s. vulgare has a fruit diameter of 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in), while var. microcarpum fruits have a diameter of 1.5–3 mm (0.059–0.12 in). Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, e.g. Morocco, India and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1-0.4%). They are used extensively for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content of around 0.4-1.8%, so are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil.\n' +
            'It is commonly found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Seeds can be roasted or heated on a dry pan briefly before grinding to enhance and alter the aroma. Ground coriander seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh.\n' +
            'Coriander seed is a spice in garam masala and Indian curries, which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin. It acts as a thickener. Roasted coriander seeds, calleddhana dal, are eaten as a snack. It is the main ingredient of the two south Indian dishes: sambhar and rasam. Coriander seeds are boiled with water and drunk as indigenous medicine for colds.\n' +

In Russia and Central Europe, coriander seed is an occasional ingredient in rye bread as an alternative to caraway. Coriander seeds are used in European cuisine today, though they were more important in former centuries. The Zuni people have adapted it into their cuisine, mixing the powdered seeds ground with chile and using it a condiment with meat, and eating leaves as a salad.\n' +

Fava are one of the ancient cultivated crops probably originated in the fertile valleys of Asia Minor or Mediterranean region. Unlike in green beans where whole immature pods eaten, broad beans possess thick indigestible cover that is generally shelled to extract broad, thick, and flat seeds (beans) inside. They are one of the popular vegetables to grow and can be easily grown in home gardens.\n' +

            'The beans are very rich source of dietary fiber (66% per100g RDA) which acts as a bulk laxative that helps to protect the mucous membrane of the colon by decreasing its exposure time to toxic substances as well as by binding to cancer-causing chemicals in the colon. Dietary fiber has also been shown to reduce blood cholesterol levels by decreasing re-absorption of cholesterol binding bile acids in the colon.\n' +
            'Broad beans are rich in phyto-nutrients such as isoflavone and plant-sterols. Isoflavone such asgenistein and daidzein have been found to protect breast cancer in laboratory animals. Phytosterols, especially ?-sitosterol, help lower cholesterol levels in the body.\n' +
            'Fava beans contain Levo-dopa or L-dopa, a precursor of neuro-chemicals in the brain such as dopamine, epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Dopamine in the brain is associated with smooth functioning of body movements. Getting adequate fava beans in the diet may help prevent Parkinson’s disease and dopamine responsive dystonia disorders. (Medical disclaimer).\n' +
            'Fresh fava beans are an excellent source of folates. 100 g beans provide 423 µg or 106% of folates. Folate along with vitamin B-12 is one of the essential components of DNA synthesis and cell division. Adequate folate in the diet around conception and during pregnancy may help prevent neural-tube defects in the newborn baby.\n' +
            'They also contain good amounts of vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin and niacin. These vitamins function as co-enzymes in cellular metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat.\n' +
            'In addition, broad beans are one of the fine sources of minerals like iron, copper, manganese, calcium, magnesium. At 1062 mg or 23% of daily recommended levels, fava are one of the highest plant sources of potassium. Potassium is an important electrolyte of cell and body fluids. It helps counter pressing effects of sodium on heart and blood pressure.',

Rape originated in northern Europe and was cultivated near the Mediterranean Sea, but is now grown throughout the world. Canola, a selectively bred variant of Rape, was developed in the late 1970s in Canada as a more nutritious source of vegetable oil than Rape seed.\n' +
            'Rape seed contains 2 main storage proteins, a high-molecular-mass legumin-like 12 S globulin and a low-molecular-mass 2 S protein (also known as napin or nIII) (2-4,6, 9).The 2 S protein has been characterised as the following:Bra n 1, a 2S albumin (napin); the protein consists of 2 different chains of 9.5 and 4.5 kDa (5-12).\n' +

            text: '<strong>The common oat (Avena sativa) is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other grains). While oats are suitable for human consumption as oatmeal and rolled oats, one of the most common uses is as livestock feed. Oats are the only cereal containing a globulin or legume-like protein, avenalin, as the major (80%) storage protein.[12] Globulins are characterised by solubility in dilute saline. The more typical cereal proteins, such as gluten and zein, areprolamines (prolamins). The minor protein of oat is a prolamine, avenin.\n' +
            'Oat protein is nearly equivalent in quality to soy protein, which World Health Organization research has shown to be equal to meat, milk, and egg protein.[13] The protein content of the hull-less oat kernel (groat) ranges from 12 to 24%, the highest among cereals. As in all grains, oats contain phytic acid in the outer layer of the bran. If untreated, phytic acid can bind to minerals like calcium and block their absorption. Thus, diets high in raw or uncooked whole grains may lead to mineral deficiencies and other health risks.[19]\n' +
            'Soaking or cooking (and thus softening) these whole grains allow enzymes and other organisms to break down and neutralize phytic acid so that it won’t bind to the body’s essential nutrient when consumed.\n' +
            'In addition, unprocessed grains are still seeds that contain certain compounds that stop the enzyme activity of germination to help them sprout at the right time. This makes it possible for these whole grain seeds to pass through the body undigested. If not fully prepared, the raw oats will still carry these compounds into the body and hinder digestive enzymes. Soaking or softening these whole grains make them more digestible and gives the body access to all of its nutrients.</strong>',

            text: 'The main reason they’re gaining traction is because pea protein is rich in branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), protein compounds that have been shown to delay fatigue during exercise. That’s exciting, because the amount of BCAAs in pea protein comes close to those found in milk and eggs, but is less likely to cause allergic reactions or intolerances. Pea protein also contains arginine, an amino acid shown to enhance immunity, fight erectile dysfunction and improve fertility. The lysine content in peas helps the body absorb calcium and decreases the amount of calcium lost in urine, thus helping to maintain strong bones. And peas are a plant, so it’s a protein source that’s lower on the food chain (thus more “green”), and in line with the general shift towards a plant-based diet.\n' +
            'When protein is isolated from a food, it’s more compact. One quarter of a cup of dry yellow split-peas contains about 10 grams of protein, along with 28 grams of carbohydrate. But one scoop of Now Foods’ unflavored non-GMO pure pea protein powder packs 28 grams of protein, slightly more than a 3-ounce chicken breast, with just 1 gram of carbs.',
