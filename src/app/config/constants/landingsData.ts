      text: 'A serving size of pumpkin seeds, which equals approximately 1/2 cup, contains an average of 8 g of protein. Pumpkin seeds are good sources of protein and other nutrients. Combine them with granola, raisins and nuts in snacks and cereals, or use them instead of nuts in baked goods. Pumpkin seeds don’t contribute as much protein as beans, meat or some dairy products, but because they contribute protein to the complex carbohydrates found in cereals, salads and breads, they are useful for building a balanced meal. As a source of protein, pumpkin seeds compare favorably to other seeds and to nuts. To consume the 25 g to 28 g of protein found in the recommended 3g. serving of tuna or 1 cup of soybeans, you’d have to eat about 2 cups of dried pumpkin seeds. That’s 613 calories, compared to the 110 calories of the tuna or the 298 calories of the soybeans. 1oz. of pumpkin seeds offers almost 30 percent of the recommended daily amount of zinc and 20 percent of the recommended amount of iron. They also contribute magnesium, fiber and omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.',
